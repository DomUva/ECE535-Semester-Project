1. Understand multimodal federated learning.
2. Use the given datasets to reproduce the results in the paper.
3. Perform a per-class accuracy analysis of the results and observe the effect of skewed data distribution on the per-class accuracy.
4. Evaluate the system on a multimodal dataset that is relatively balanced in class distribution.
5. An implementation of the code using the given resources
6. Steady documentation of what is used and references

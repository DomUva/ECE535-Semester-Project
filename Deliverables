Understand multimodal federated learning.
Use the given datasets to reproduce the results in the paper.
Perform a per-class accuracy analysis of the results and observe the effect of skewed data distribution on the per-class accuracy.
Evaluate the system on a multimodal dataset that is relatively balanced in class distribution.

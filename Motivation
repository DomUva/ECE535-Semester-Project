The number of IoT devices has increased substantially in recent years and with this comes the constant collection of data.
This can lead to challenges when trying to keep your data safe. Normal machine learning methods cause data to be sent to a
centralized server which could pose a threat to security. With the use of federated learning (FI), we can have multiple parties
collaborating to train one model while keeping their individual data private. This project will look into the use of multimodal
federated learning models to help sustain a superior level of privacy while also enhancing the system's performance.
